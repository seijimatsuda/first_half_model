## 🚀 Quick Start (Choose Your Method)

### Method 1: Enhanced Scanner (Recommended) ⭐
```bash
python3 enhanced_betting_scanner.py
```
**Benefits**: Fast, efficient, focuses only on relevant matches

### Method 2: Full Scan with Progress
```bash
python3 start_betting_alerts.py
```
**Benefits**: Progress tracking, auto-opens results file

### Method 3: Specific Search
```bash
python3 search_specific.py
```
**Benefits**: Search by country/league or team name

### Method 4: Chat Interface
```bash
python3 chat_interface.py
```
**Benefits**: Natural language commands

### Method 5: Legacy Scanner
```bash
python3 live_betting_scanner.py
```
**Benefits**: Original method (slower but comprehensive)

## 📊 How It Works (Enhanced)

### New Efficient Pipeline:
1. **🎯 Match Discovery**: Finds all matches happening in next 24 hours (291 matches vs 1000+ leagues)
2. **⚡ Targeted Analysis**: Analyzes only discovered matches for team performance
3. **📈 Smart Filtering**: Uses 4+ total matches per team (not 4+ home/away matches)
4. **🚨 Alert Generation**: Identifies matches with ≥1.5 combined first-half goal average
5. **📁 Output**: Creates detailed text file with betting recommendations

### Performance Comparison:
- **Old Method**: Scan 1000+ leagues → 20+ minutes → High API costs
- **New Method**: Discover 291 matches → 3 minutes → 95% fewer API calls

## 💬 Chat Interface Commands

The chat interface supports natural language commands:

```
💬 Command: run full scan
💬 Command: search England leagues
💬 Command: analyze Premier League in England
💬 Command: find Manchester United next match
💬 Command: search for Real Madrid
💬 Command: help
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

- **Threshold**: 1.5 combined first-half goals
- **Minimum matches**: 4 total matches per team (ENHANCED)
- **Scan period**: Next 24 hours
- **Rate limiting**: 1.5 seconds between API calls
- **API Key**: Already configured in `config.py`

## 🎯 Betting Strategy

- **Target**: First Half Over 0.5 Goals
- **Method**: Lay betting (betting against Under 0.5)
- **Formula**: `(home_team_home_avg + away_team_away_avg) / 2`
- **Alert**: When combined average ≥ 1.5
- **Data Requirement**: 4+ total matches per team (not 4+ home/away)
